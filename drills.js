/* 
Question 1 What is the Big O for this?
1. O(i) - because it is selecting one object from the array.

2. O(n) - because you are looping through the entire array. */

/* 
2. Even or odd
O(i) Only one action is ocurring, one time. No matter what the value of value is. 
*/

/* 
3. Are you here?
O(n^2) nested loops with linear iterations
*/

/* 
4. Doubler
O(n) the function grows linearly based upon teh length of the array.
*/

/* 
5. Naive search
O(n) linear search through the array
*/

/* 
6. Creating pairs
O(n^2) - nested linear operations
*/

/* 
7. Compute the sequence
O(n) - linear loooping through  result array

First iteration 0 is pushed to the end of the array.
Second 1 is pushed
and so on.
*/

/* 
8. An efficient search
O(logn) the subset to search gets smaller after each iteration
*/

/* 
9. Random element
O(i)
*/

/* 
10. What Am I?
The function checks to see if the input number is not a prime number. O(n)
*/

/* 
11. Tower of Hanoi
